WIP story/chars lol

So yeah here are the characters

Profundissimus Tagrunius (protag)
Queen Anne (keytar) {ghost} female [status effect]
Sam Heather (bassist) {<3ringo} [strong attack]
Ringo Starr (drummer) {<3sam} [weak attack]
Kubo Nephmos (fiddle player) {halfling}[range]
Ok so prologue protag is a blank slate. Got no past and as far as he can tell no future but he gets thrown out of his apartment and replaced as the lead guitarist and so he goes to the luctus river and throws his guitar in the river and walks away. The guitar floats out of the river into the air with a halo like light glowing around its head. Protag opens his hand and the guitar comes to him. He looks at his guitar in shock.
He goes for a walk in the woods and finds a womans skeleton with a weird accordion next to her. He takes the sword thats lodged in her ribcage but it flies out of his hand and cuts the head off the skeleton. He takes the skull and puts it in his bag with the accordion. He sees more skeletons but most of them are buried. While walking he hears harmonica playing but he doesnt notice it at first. When he notices it he readies his guitar and shouts whos there. Then he realizes that hes the cliche ‘i die first in a horror movie’ and pulls out a granola bar from his bag. Might as well die well fed.
Then the realisation hit him. That sounds exactly like the harmonica in his bag so he rakes in his bag to find the skull playing his harmonica. The skull smiled and a ghost came out of his bag. ‘Hey im Anne. Queen Anne!! So err. Whatcha doin here?’ Protag doesnt seem too freaked out and just shrugged. ‘Long story… just feelin sad went for a walk.’ She smiled ‘Well i have eternity to spend…’ 
1 HOUR LATER
‘So thats it? Ok better get you home the… thats the temple of beginnings!!’ He looked at it. It somehow resembled a pyramid. ‘I can read the sign.’ The ghost shook ‘I cant go in there last time a ghost did they disappeared.’ Protag sighed and entered. The rooms are basic and looks something like binding of issac rooms. Same texture for all rooms eventually some rooms and a shop you can buy healthing items from. The first boss appears. Its an egg with chicken legs. Its called breakfast, lunch and dinner. When you kill him a alter appears and a demon with goat legs, sunglasses and a leather jacket. ‘Hey if you use that alter ill give you a curse.’
He pulls out a phone. ‘Just break his legs. That didnt work? Have you tried doing it with a cardboard cut out of the number 8 try that.’ He sighs and sees protag confused at the alter. ‘Hey curses arent all bad they just have a bad wrap.’ 
{beginnings curse=levels are slower now but faster later}
When you take it your visual clothes change and the number 1 in blue ink appears on your arm. After you agree or disagree he teleports you out and you speak to ann. “You look tired, protag. You should go home” so they go to a motel nearby and sleep. You have a choice to let Ann sleep in the same room. 

will not be in first few demo and proto builds lol (will be added l8er)
