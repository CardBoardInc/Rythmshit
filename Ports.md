Note: Clickteam is required for porting. (please buy the engine, dont pirate it, you can get it from their online store or on steam)

You can port this to anything, actually. Linux, Mac, HTML5, Emscripten, Switch (homebrew), etc!
If your port is up to good quality, we may even ask to officially add it to the Releases page, although this is all up to you. (we will not force you, we respect you if you take the itme to do stuff like this)
Also, the game will be free. for now at least
